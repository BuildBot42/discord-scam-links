# Contributing

Below are some general rules & guidelines to keep in mind before and while contributing:

1. Are your submitted links already in the [list](https://github.com/BuildBot42/discord-scam-links/blob/main/list.txt)? Please do check against all of your submitted links beforehand to avoid duplicates!
1. Are your submitted links **Discord** phishing links? This is a repository focused on cataloguing Discord-based and Discord-imitating phishing links, so please keep submissions relevant!
1. Are your submitted links **scam** links? Aside from the most common `discord.com`/`discordapp.com` domains, Discord has a lot of other official domains that are less well-known - be sure to check [Delitefully's unofficial list](https://github.com/Delitefully/DiscordLists/blob/master/domains.md) to see them all!
1. Are your submitted links a **phishing** domain? Please do not submit malicious subdomains or paths of non-malicious domains (e.g., `bit.ly/3fXgA2e`, `scam-subdomain.github.io`). This includes submitting subdomains in general - if the domain is malicious, it can be assumed that all the subdomains are as well!
2. [`Optional`] Are you putting your submissions in such that they're alphabetized in the overall list? While not a requirement, it's helpful to leave the alphabetization intact.

Thanks for contributing!
